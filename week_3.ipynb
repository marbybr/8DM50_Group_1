In this study (['Iorio et al., Cell, 2016']()), 265 compounds were tested on 1001 cancer cell lines for which different types of -omics data (RNA expression, DNA methylation, Copy Number Alteration, DNA sequencing) are available. This is a valuable resource to look for biomarkers of drugs sensitivity in order to try to understand why cancer patients responds very differently to cancer drugs and find ways to assign the optimal treatment to each patient.\n",

Drug sensitivity is measured using the natural log of the fitted IC50 metric, which is defined as the half maximal inhibitory concentration.
